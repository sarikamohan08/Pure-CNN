# Pure-CNN
 In order to recognize numbers(MNIST dataset) more accurately, A new method was proposed which is  Pure Convolutional Neural Network (PCNN)  with minimum number of parameters  we can achieve the maximum acccuracy.
 In this repo  PCNN consists of 8 convolutional layers with some dropout and batch normalization layers and got the accuracy of 99.44%
